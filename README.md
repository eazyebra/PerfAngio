This repository contains the work I did as part of a medical imaging class at UCLA.
In addition, it contains the work I did for a project in this class over the summer.
Our team trained traditional ML models and a neural network to learn the function mapping between DSA images,
which are X-rays over time showing blood flow, and blood flow parameter images.
